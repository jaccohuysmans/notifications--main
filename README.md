Notifications

Why?
The Notifications project is a project that grew out of a technical assessment I went through during a job interview once.  I decided to put up it's own repositories for it and expand it using different technologies each time. Hopefully this way it will be of some use to someone in the future and maybe inspire others to add more technology variants in the future.

What?
The technical assesment consisted, among other things, out of an evaluation of the following assignment:
Build a mobile client that can store a users location together with some text to a backend system which persists it in some form. Also develop a client that administrators can use to see on a map which notifactions were stored at what location.

How?
At that time I developed an Android app, a  Play-Java based backend, and a webclient using ExtJs. Since I was being interviewd for a job as a java developer I focused on functionality rather then user experience optimisation. The apps are therefore pretty basic. I also opted to persist the data using ElasticSearch for no other particluar reason then that I realy like it. -)
